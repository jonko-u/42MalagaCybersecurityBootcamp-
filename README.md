# II Edition of the Cybersecurity Bootcamp in 42

Campus 42 is throwing itself fully into cybersecurity training by opening registrations for this new edition of the Cybersecurity Bootcamp.

According to data from the Employment Map published by Fundación Telefónica, in Spain there are almost 1750 vacancies to be filled in the field of cybersecurity. You have the opportunity to train in one of the most sought-after digital skills not only in the technological field, but also in any company or institution in sectors as diverse as transport, health, public administration, finance or electricity. All this, 100% free of charge and under the 42 methodology, the most innovative in the world.

Some of the people who participated in the previous edition of our Cybersecurity Bootcamp are already working in the cybersecurity sector.

## 8 weeks for learning new skills
During the 8 weeks, you can learn skills in cryptography, network security, secure development and protection, web security, vulnerabilities, computer forensics, malware and malicious code, OSINT techniques and metadata, and open-source research, among others.

## Basic knowledge to face the Bootcamp
To get the most out of the contents, you must have basic programming skills (Python, C…), operating system structure and computer architecture, use of command line and complex interfaces, scripting in any language (Bash, Powershell…), use of internet, infrastructures and servers (Docker), networks, TCP/IP layers and network configuration, and an advanced user level in Windows and Linux.

This is a medium-advanced Bootcamp. For this reason, we will carry out an access test in person among all the people registered to be able to assess the previous knowledge of the candidates. From this dynamic, we will select those who will enjoy this II Edition of the Cybersecurity Bootcamp.

## Methodology
How are you going to learn then? Easy: you will be accompanied by many people like you who are willing to learn programming and who you can ask whenever you want to solve something. “Ask the person on your left, then the person on your right, then Google. Peer-to-peer learning is the basis of our learning system.

You will learn how to learn, and that means you will not only learn technical skills, but you will also increase your social skills by interacting with all kinds of people because we are a diverse and inclusive space.

## Lessons Learned
- __Project Management__: Managing a project involving Python, Docker, VirtualBox, and data recovery requires careful planning and coordination. Clearly defining project goals, milestones, and tasks helps maintain organization and progress throughout the project.

- __Understanding__ Data Recovery: Data recovery is a complex process that involves understanding file systems, storage devices, and data structures. It is crucial to have a solid understanding of data recovery techniques and tools to effectively retrieve lost or damaged data.

- __Python Programming__: Python is a versatile programming language that offers a wide range of libraries and tools for data recovery tasks. Understanding the fundamentals of Python programming and its file handling capabilities is essential for implementing data recovery algorithms and scripts.

- __Docker__: Docker is a powerful tool for creating and managing containerized environments. Leveraging Docker allows for easy deployment and reproducibility of the data recovery project across different systems. Understanding Docker concepts, such as containers, images, and Dockerfiles, is beneficial for creating a portable and scalable project environment.

- __VirtualBox__: VirtualBox is a popular virtualization software that enables running virtual machines (VMs) on a host system. Utilizing VirtualBox can provide a controlled and isolated environment for testing data recovery processes without impacting the host system. Understanding VirtualBox's configuration, networking, and VM management is important for setting up the project environment.

- __Basics of C__: C is a powerful programming language commonly used for system-level programming, including low-level operations and hardware interaction. Understanding the basics of C, such as data types, variables, control structures, and memory management, can be beneficial when working on tasks related to data recovery or interacting with system resources at a lower level.

- __Documentation and Version Control__: Proper documentation and version control are crucial for project collaboration and maintainability. Utilizing tools like Git for version control and documenting code, configurations, and processes helps in tracking changes, collaborating with others, and ensuring the project's long-term sustainability.

Overall, undertaking a project involving data recovery(Data Forensics) using Python, Docker, VirtualBox, and basic knowledge of C requires a multidisciplinary approach and a solid understanding of the technologies involved. It is important to continuously learn, adapt, and leverage the available resources and tools to overcome challenges and deliver a successful project outcome.
